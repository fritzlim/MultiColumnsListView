The project was created with a standart Xamarin.Forms Shell template, then adding custom controls inside. No custom renderers, just pure Forms.

Microsoft.CSharp nuget was added for some dynamic extensions but you can adapt to your hardcoded classes and remove it.

### How is it done

The main idea was to have several cell templates and switch them between a table row and an empty template for cells that have already been used in the row. 
The resulting look must be the following (2 columns):

[ Template1: [user template cell 1] [user template cell 2] ]

[ Template 2 ]

[ Template1: [user template cell 3] [user template cell 4] ]

[ Template 2 ]

â€¦

## ToDo: 

Explain the code, maybe create a blog post. 
Until the feel free to play with the source code, custom controls are in a shared project  so you can include them easily in your own soluctions.
The implementation is in the cross-platform project, take a look i have left some comments inside.
